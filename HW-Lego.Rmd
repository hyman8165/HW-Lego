**Question 6** Which age group has spent the most money on Legos?

```{r}
lego_agegroup %>% group_by(age_group) %>% 
  count(age_group, wt = us_price * quantity) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

The age group of 36 - 50 has spent the most money on Legos.

**Question 7** Which Lego theme has made the most money for Lego?

**Question 9** Come up with a question you want to answer using these data, and write it down. Then, create a data visualization that answers the question, and explain how your visualization answers the question.

```{r}
lego_sales %>% group_by(us_price) %>% count(us_price) %>% arrange(desc(n))
```

Answer: A question I want to answer using these data is: Which price of Lego sets purchased is most popular?

```{r}
ggplot(lego_sales, aes(us_price)) + geom_bar()
```

Using bar plot we found that the prices higher than 80 are less popular. So we limit the price from 0 to 80.

```{r}
ggplot(lego_sales, aes(us_price)) + geom_bar() + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 80))
```

Now we found the price about 10 is most popular.
